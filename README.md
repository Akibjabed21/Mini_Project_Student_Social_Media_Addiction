# Mini_Project_Student_Social_Media_Addiction
This project was built as part of my career 247 data analytics course to practice python and data visualization. 
In this project I have try to analyses the student social media usage patterns , explore demographic influences, and uncover trends that can guide awareness campaigns and digital detox program.


# Background: 
    Social media platforms have become integral to our daily lives, especially for students. While 
    they offer connectivity and entertainment, overuse can negatively impact mental health, sleep, 
    productivity, and overall well-being. Educational institutions, counselors, and parents are 
    increasingly seeking data-driven strategies to address this issue. 


# Objective: 
    Use Python (with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.) to explore the dataset and derive meaningful 
    insights. Your goal is to visualize trends and tell a compelling data story that can help reduce social media 
    addiction among students.

# Tools & Technique: 
    python & its Libraries like(pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn)
    Data Cleaning & Sorting
    Insights & Visualization


# 10-Line Story Summary:
      ###          1.  Students aged 13–18 show the highest average daily usage, often exceeding 4 hours.
      ###          2.  Female students tend to use social media slightly more than males across all age groups.
      ###          3.  Increased usage correlates with reduced sleep hours, especially among high schoolers.
      ###          4.  Academic performance drops noticeably in students with extreme usage levels.
      ###          5.  Social interaction scores decline as online hours increase, suggesting offline disengagement.
      ###          6.  Addiction levels are highest in younger age groups and those with lower academic scores.
      ###          7.  Sleep deprivation and poor grades emerge as key indicators of digital overuse.
      ###          8.  Risk classification reveals 30% of students fall into the “High” or “Extreme” usage category.
      ###          9.  Recommended actions include time-blocking apps, offline peer activities, and sleep hygiene routines.
      ###         10.  Data-driven awareness campaigns should target high-risk groups with tailored detox strategies. "
